Japanese Character Cipher - Proof of Concept

Not in the habit of rehashing things I've already written, so a blog post I wrote <a href="https://jigsy1.blogspot.com/2017/12/my-attempt-at-creating-substitution.html">here</a> [jigsy1.blogspot.com] can explain this.

If you want to try decrypting a message I wrote - which uses a completely different key structure than the example .ini file - go <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/frQ7SMZ3">here</a>. [pastebin]

<h1>Ideas:</h1>
* Wondering if spaces should also be encrypted.
* Wondering if invalid characters should use the "similar looking" characters. (ロ & 口, ニ & 二, etc.)
